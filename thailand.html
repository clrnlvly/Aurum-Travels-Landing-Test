                                World War II under the Japanese occupation. The construction of the railway was a tragic
                                and harrowing chapter in history, as it involved the forced labor of thousands of Allied
                                prisoners of war and Asian laborers, many of whom died due to harsh working conditions,
                                malnutrition, and disease.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">The most famous part of the railway is the stretch through
                                Kanchanaburi Province in Thailand, where visitors can walk along the tracks, visit the
                                famous Bridge on the River Kwai, and explore the associated museums and war cemeteries.
